# Leptos Spin SSR Starter Template

This is a template for use with the [Leptos][leptos] web framework and the [Spin][spin-install] WASI platform.

[Click here to see the deployed version of this starter](https://spin-leptos-ssr-49mccqzz.fermyon.app).

## Creating Your Repo

First, ensure that you have Rust 'nightly' with both the `wasm` and `wasm32-wasi` targets, along with `cargo-generate`
- `rustup toolchain install nightly --allow-downgrade`
- `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- `rustup target add wasm32-wasi`
- `cargo install cargo-generate`

If you don't have `spin` installed you can install it with

```bash
curl -fsSL https://developer.fermyon.com/downloads/install.sh | bash
```

Once you have the Spin CLI tool downloaded, we recommend putting the binary into a folder already on your path, eg

```sh
sudo mv spin /usr/local/bin/
```

For the full [Spin CLI install instructions see here][spin-install].

<br/>

To generate your own repo from this starter template, run
```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/leptos-rs/start-spin
```

Then

```sh
cd spin-test
```

to go to your newly created project.

<br/>

Feel free to explore the project structure, but the best place to start with your application code is in `src/pages/home.rs`.


Additionally, Cargo.toml may need updating as new versions of the dependencies are released, especially if things are not working after a `cargo update`.

## Running & Developing Your Project

Running
```sh
spin watch
```

will build and run your server as well as recompile your code after making changes.

Using
```sh
spin up
```
will build and serve your app on `127.0.0.1:3000` by default. To serve at a different address, use `spin up --listen <ADDRESS>`.


## Release and Deployment

To deploy your app to [Fermyon Cloud signup here first][spin-signup]. For more information on [Ferymon Cloud see here][spin-cloud-info].

After you have your Fermyon cloud account and have logged in using `spin login`, running
```sh
spin build
```
will build your application for release. Running

```sh
spin deploy
```
will publish your app to Fermyon cloud.

If you would prefer to deploy your app on own machine or in a VM with Docker rather than on Fermyon Cloud, see [the Spin in Docker setup instructions here][docker-spin].

If you would like to deploy your Leptos-Spin app via Kubernetes, see [the setup instructions for Spin on Kubernetes here][k8s-spin].
